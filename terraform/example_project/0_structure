Explanation
main.tf: Contains the resource definitions for the VPC, subnet, security group, EC2 instance, and S3 bucket.
variables.tf: Defines the input variables used in the Terraform configuration.
outputs.tf: Specifies the output values that will be displayed after the infrastructure is created.
terraform.tfvars: Provides values for the input variables, allowing customization without modifying the main configuration files.
backend.tf: Configures Terraform to use an S3 bucket for storing the Terraform state file remotely. This is useful for collaboration and maintaining state consistency.
This example demonstrates how to structure a Terraform project with multiple files, making it easier to manage and maintain infrastructure as code.
