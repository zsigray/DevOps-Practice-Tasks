***⚠️ REPOSITORY UNDER CONSTRUCTION⚠️***

I am currently updating this repository, writing detailed descriptions and working out folder and file structure.

# DevOps Practice Tasks

ℹ️ In this repository, you will find the practice files I am creating while preparing for my final assessment at Codecool. 

## Expectations for the assessment:


### Bash
For this section, you are expected to write and execute Bash scripts efficiently. Your scripts should demonstrate proficiency with tools such as `sed`, `jq`, and `curl`. You need to be comfortable using subshells `[$()]`, arithmetic expressions `[$(())]`, and be adept at using piping `[|]` along with input/output redirection `[>,>>,<<]`. Your scripts should also include conditional statements (`if`), loops (`for`), and functions. You should know how to handle script arguments. The final deliverable will be a `.sh` file that executes successfully.

### Docker
In this part, you will create a `Dockerfile` that meets the specified requirements. The goal is to ensure that the Docker image builds successfully. The expected output is a well-structured `Dockerfile` and a confirmed successful build of the Docker image.

### Docker-Compose
For the Docker-Compose section, you will review and extend an existing solution involving an Nginx server and a Flask application. Your task is to integrate an application (provided to you), Nginx, and a database into a cohesive system using `docker-compose`. The deliverable will be a `docker-compose.yml` file that, when executed, runs the system successfully.

### Kubernetes
You are required to demonstrate your understanding of Kubernetes by working with basic resource types such as namespaces, deployments, services, configmaps, secrets, and roles. You need to create appropriate manifest files for these resources. The expected output is a set of manifest files that correctly define and deploy these resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Terraform (AWS)
In the Terraform section, you will be tasked with creating AWS infrastructure. This includes resources such as S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, IAM roles, and networking configurations. You should reference the Terraform documentation as needed. The final deliverables are `.tf` files that, when applied, successfully create the specified AWS infrastructure.
